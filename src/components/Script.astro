<div>
  If a single Astro component with a script tag is used multiple times on a
  page, the script tag is processed and only included once.
</div>

<div>
  Astro will process and insert the script in the head tag of the page with a
  type=module attribute. The implication of type=module is that the browser will
  defer the script, i.e., load in parallel and execute it only after the pageâ€™s
  parsed.
</div>

<script>
  // interactive scripts or client-side scripts

  //tips of interactive script :
  //The most crucial point is that Astro processes these. This means within a <script>, we can import other scripts or import npm packages, and Astro will resolve and package the script for use in the browser.
  //NPM packages and local files can be imported and will be bundled
  //valid:  <script src="path-to-script.js" />
  //Another critical point is the <script> fully supports TypeScript.
</script>
